# Green

🌱Global warming has been a well-known issue since 1896, and governments and companies worldwide are working hard trying to solve this problem. 
- New regulations for vehicle manufacturers come out every year and countless clean energy solutions for public transportation. 
- Yet, we still don't have a feasible solution to reduce the number of single person in the vehicle on the road. 
- Here at Green, we're trying to build a complete, open, and free-to-use platform for our customers to share their rides
- in order to save more energy, improve the efficiency, and reduce the pollution🌍

📝This project is written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, MySQL and framework BootStrap.

🤩At the end,
 I would like to express my gratitude to my teammates @LINZHU and @LIFAN ZENG.
